# PathfinderVisualizer

Description
-----------
Welcome to Pathfinder Visualizer. I build this application because I am interesting pathfinding algorithms, and I want to visualize them. I hope you find fun and enjoy playing round with this application as much as I enjoy building it.

Algorithms
-----
Dijkstra's algorithm: the grandfather of pathfinding algorithm. This pathfinding algorithm will guarantee the shortest path.
<br><br>
A Search*: the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path and faster than Dijkstra's algorithm.

Installation
-----------------------------------
Need the latest pip and pygame version.

To run the application
----------------------
Clone the repos:
and run the application in the build folder

Demo (Youtube Link)
